This is a project that implements LED memory game Simon Says. You can implement this project by using an Arduino Uno after creating the circuit of the project,
connect the corresponding pins to the Arduino Board. Upload the given .ino code into the Arduino. By this point you can play the Simon Says game physically 
with your Arduino. By connecting Arduino serial with processing with the given .pde code you can play the game on your computer at the same time with your arduino.

In Arduino code:
The game continues until the player achieves the 10 round without any fail and they win the game. 
In each round the game gets faster and the number of leds blink increases by one.

In the processing code:
The player can play the game simultaneously with the arduino board by entering corresponding letter to the color (yellow = y, red = r, green = g, blue = b) 
or by clicking the corresponding circle seen on the computer screen.

Circuit components needed:
An Arduino
A Breadboard
A Buzzer
4 LEDs (different colors would be better)
Four 220 ohm resistor
4 Push-Button
Male-Male jumper cables
